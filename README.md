# BearScript 🐻

> A programming language where learning feels like play, but teaches you real skills.

## The BearScript Philosophy

BearScript is built on two core beliefs:

1. **🐻 Learning Should Be Joyful**  
   Code should spark curiosity, not intimidation. We wrap programming concepts in playful, bear-themed syntax to make your first steps memorable and fun.

2. **🛠️ Learning Should Always Teach You To Be Practical**  
   Behind every playful keyword is a serious programming concept. What you learn in BearScript directly applies to languages like Python, JavaScript, and C.

## Why BearScript Exists

Most programming languages are created for:
- Building websites and apps (JavaScript, Python)
- Creating systems software (C, Rust)
- Data science and AI (Python, R)

**BearScript is different.** It's created for:
- Making your **first lines of code** unforgettable
- Understanding **how programming languages actually work**
- Building **real programming skills** through playful metaphors

## What Makes BearScript Special

| BearScript Feature | The Fun Part | The Practical Skill You Learn |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| `growl 5` | The bear "growls" your output | Using `print()`/`console.log()` |
| `a = 5` → `a: int = 5` | Start simple, unlock complexity | Dynamic vs. static typing |
| `let age: int = 5` (future) | Values that don't change | Immutable variables (like in Rust) |
| `whisper()` (future) | Gentle error messages | Error handling and debugging |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/rahmatadistiapro/BearScript
cd BearScript/bearscript
gcc -o bearscript [your source files]

# Start the interactive interpreter
./bearscript
>>> growl "Hello, Forest!"
Hello, Forest!

# Run a BearScript file
./bearscript examples/main.bearscript

```
## Language Goals
- **Be fun** - Because learning should spark joy  
- **Be helpful** - Every concept teaches something real
- **Make people laugh** - With bear-themed surprises
- **Teach about coding** - How languages work under the hood  
- **Make people have a great day** - While building real skills

## The Story Behind the Name
The name "BearScript" was inspired by Freddy Fazbear from *Five Nights at Freddy's*—a bear character who's both friendly and full of surprises. Just like our language: **approachable on the surface, with deep learning possibilities underneath.**

## For the Curious Minds

BearScript is written entirely in **C (100%)**, which means you can:
*   See exactly how an interpreter works
*   Learn how lexers, parsers, and evaluators function
*   Understand the journey from source code to execution

## Contributing

This is a hobby project with a big heart! Whether you're 11 or 110, if you believe learning should be both **joyful and practical**, your ideas and contributions are welcome.
