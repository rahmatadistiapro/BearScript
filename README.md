# BearScript

# Created in Thursday, 18 of december 2025

a hobby language i made
NOTE: i am not Rahmat adistia im his son and im 11 years old
BearScript is a simple programming language designed for beginners to learn programming concepts easily. It features a straightforward syntax and is inspired by popular languages like Python and C so mixing Python's dynamic nature with C static nature to get a dual nature of static and dynamic some of the stuff in here will have bear related things such as growl the name bearscript was inspired by the game five nights at freddy's by the character freddy fazbear which is a bear.

Goals: to be fun, helpful, make people laugh, teach about coding, and make people have a great day

it is designed to be fun not some serious politics or group meeting in the mailing lists i want to give happiness not learning the programming for you to get a job then money just pure happiness

## Syntax Idea:
## datatypes:
### string:
"" and ''

### integer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0

### float:
1.0, 2.5, 3.14

### boolean:
true, false
 
## comments:
// <- this is a comment

## printing:
growl value; // also ; is optional

## var declaration:
dynamic version: name = "John"
static mutable version: let age: int = 25;
static immutable version: let const name: str = "John"

## control flow
if condition
  code block
else if condition
  code block
else
  code block
end

though the Syntax is just the idea i'll prototyped on making it work
