BearScript is a simple programming language designed for beginners to learn programming concepts easily. It features a straightforward syntax and is inspired by popular languages like Python and C so mixing Python's dynamic nature with C static nature to get a dual nature of static and dynamic some of the stuff in here will have bear related things such as growl the name bearscript was inspired by the game five nights at freddy's by the character freddy fazbear which is a bear.

Goals: to be fun, helpful, make people laugh, teach about coding, and make people have a great day

it is designed to be fun not some serious politics or group meeting in the mailing lists i want to give happiness not learning the programming for you to get a job then money just pure happiness

and one of BearScript philosophy's are:
-- Learning Should Be Joyful --
-- Learning Should Always Teach You To Be practical --
